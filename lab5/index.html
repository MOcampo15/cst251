		<h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
	</center>
	<h2>Purpose:</h2>
	<p>The purpose of lab 5 is to create a web page with images and be able to
	link to other websites using the images or text link.</p>
	<h2>Challenges:</h2>
	<p>After completing the lab, we faced very few challenges and we were able
	to get our pages to work as we wanted them to. One of the few challenges we
  faced was being able to correctly link the images to our websites and testing
  them to make sure they worked on our local machine before we were able to
 	push them up to our server.</p>

	<h2>Results:</h2>
	<p>Below are the results for Lab 5: More HTML </p>
