          <p> Some random facts about me are that I'm bilingual with my first language
          being Spanish, I love to draw on my free time, I really enjoy cooking and trying
          new recipes, when I was 12 I got bit by a baby tiger on my arm (long story), and
          I love listening to music whenever I can. I love traveling and last year during
          January I was able to travel to Seoul, South Korea with my older sister. I
          also travel to Mexico very often with my family.</p>
