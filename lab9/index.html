        <h2 class="title">Purpose:</h2>
        <p>The purpose of Lab 9 is to organize our page with tag elements.
           We are also expected to style various block-level HTML elements
           with CSS. </p>
        <h2 class="title">Challenges:</h2>
        <p>We didn't face many challenges when completing Lab 9 as we
           we knew how to style the elements well, it was just a matter
           of getting everything organized and styled according to their
           attributes, classes, and ids.</p>
        <h2 class="title">Results:</h2>
        <p>Displayed in our webpage are the results of Lab 9.</p>
