	</u>
		<h2>Purpose: </h2>
		<p> The main purpose of this lab is to start to understand
			the importance of file structure as well as how to create
			and edit index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges:</h2>
		<p>While working on the lab, there weren't many challenges that we faced
		as many of the files had been created prior to starting the lab. We only
		had questions regarding the screenshots that we need to include as well
		as the overall structure, however, we were quickly able to resolve the issues.
		</p>
		<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>You are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file
			structure:</p>
