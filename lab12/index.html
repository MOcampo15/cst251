    <h2 class="title">Purpose:</h2>
      <p>The purpose Lab 12 is to be able to experiment with more advanced
      block-level styling and to be able to style different elements within our
      CSS file and manipulate certains tags and attributes.</p>
    <h2 class="title">Challenges:</h2>
      <p>We didn't face any challenges when completing Lab 12, it was just a
        matter of getting everything organized.</p>
    <h2 class="title">Results:</h2>
      <p>Displayed above and below in our webpage are the results of our Lab 12</p>
