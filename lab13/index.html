    <h2 class="title">Purpose:</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this lab is to be able to use block-level styling
      and to be able to use different elements of typography in order to recreate
      a webpage of our choice.</p>
    <h2 class="title">Challenges:</h2>
      <p>The challenges that we faced while completing Lab 13 were that there were
      different elements that we had to work on in our website. We thought it would
      be a relatively easy page to work on, but we kept on having to include different
      parts and making sure that each part was where it should be on the page. It
      took us a couple of hours to complete the page as there were many times in which we
      had to go back and forth fixing details.</p>
    <h2 class="title">Results:</h2>
      <p>Displayed below in our webpage are the results of our Lab 13</p>
