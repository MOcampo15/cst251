    <h2 class="title">Purpose:</h2>
      <p>The purpose Lab 21 is to refer to the sketches that we made for our previous lab
      and get feedback from our team. After we received feedback we then were to create
      more developed sketches </p>
    <h2 class="title">Challenges:</h2>
      <p>I didn't face many challenges while completing Lab 21, it would just take
        me a little while to come up with more detailed sketches for our team's websit.</p>
    <h2 class="title">Results:</h2>
      <p>Displayed below webpage are the more refined and developed sketches that I created
      for the top three choices that my team had come up with.
      <br><br>
      <b>Everett:</b>I had like your third layout the best, I think it has a lot of elements that we could use
      in our final website. Maybe try deciding what colors would work for each part of the page best
      and what you meant by your featured section on the left side.
      <br><br>
      <b>Kayla:</b> I liked your third layout the best as well, I liked the sidebar and the nav bar
      that was alone at the top as well. Maybe try seeing what other elements we could include and
      adjust them as well, but overall they were good. </p>
